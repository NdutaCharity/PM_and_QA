# Product Management Track

  Product management is the role and function within an organization that is responsible for a product's overall success. 
  Product Managers work with groups inside and outside of the company to build and execute a plan to make sure the product best meets its financial and strategic goals.
  
  This is my personal Repo to track my progress.
